# Language Survey in Manipur, India

As part of our initiative to understand language development and bridge gaps among lesser-spoken languages, we are conducting a focused survey in the state of Manipur, India.

Manipur is home to a diverse range of ethnic tribes and communities totaling around 33 distinct ethnic tribes and communities. Across these groups, approximately 29 different languages and dialects are spoken, reflecting the regionâ€™s rich linguistic heritage.

Among these, the [Tarao tribe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yfHHhoyaEo) stands out due to its critically endangered language and culture. This highlights the urgent need to document and support such vulnerable languages.

Based on the findings, we will prioritize the development and support of the languages covered in the survey to ensure their preservation and continued vitality.

With rapid technological change influencing communication patterns, there is a pressing need to understand, preserve, and promote these underrepresented languages. Through this survey, we aim to gather insights on language use, preservation, and evolution throughout Manipur.

**We invite community members, educators, and native speakers across Manipur to participate in this important effort. Your voice is key to safeguarding your linguistic heritage.**
